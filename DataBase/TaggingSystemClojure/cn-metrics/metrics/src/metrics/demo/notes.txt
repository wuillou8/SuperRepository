le cose piu importante sono:
- generate all of the necessary events and send them to GA (click on product, add/remove from shopping cart, purchase cart, etcâ€¦)
- request metrics and get back exactly what we expect
- compute aggregates over these events so we know overall stats on stuff like (most clicked products, trending, etc.)
